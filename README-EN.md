# ausgangssperre.io - The official Pass A38

[➡ zur deutschen Version](README.md)

[➡ information for developers and contributors](DEVELOPMENT.md)

ausgangssperre.io is an app for users to decide whether it is wise to go out of
their home for a given task. Should the user choose to leave their home, the app
generates a certificate with the intended destination and the reason.

## Setting

Shelter in place is currently mandated for all German states because of
COVID-19. When people leave the house, the police might require a document
stating the intent for leaving their home, similar to the one already in action
in France.

## Scenario

A person needs to leave their house and can not or does not want to print out
the form. They heard via radio/TV/social media that there also exists an App for
this. They find the App on Play Store/App Store, install and open it.

In the app, the user chooses an activity and destination. The app provides users
with information about the destination, such as whether it is currently legal to
go there, how crowded the destination is expected to be, and whether there are any
alternatives available.

Should the user decide to leave their home, the app generates a digital pass
("Ausgangsschein"). Users can show this pass to the police during controls,
certifying that they are pursuing an essential and legal activity.

## Goals

-   Help users stay at home. The app warns users when they are about to do
    something dangerous or illegal. It also provides alternative actions.
-   Help users when they have to go out and reduce anxiety about controls.
-   Make it quicker, easier and more environmentally friendly to get one's
    Ausgangsschein.
-   Be a source of reliable and accessible information in the complex jungle of
    local regulations.
