## Setting

Shelter in place for all German states because of COVID-19. In order to go 
out the police require a document stating the intent for leaving their home, 
similar to the one already in action in France. 

# Scenario

A person needs to leave their house and can not or doesn’t want to print out 
the form. They heard via Radio/TV/Social Media that there also exists an App 
for this.They find the App on Play-Store/App-Store, installs and opens it.
 
They first need to answer a few simple questions (Name/State) and next they 
get to choose what activity they would like to go. Should they need the digital 
pass for leaving the house (“Ausgangsschein”) they would get more questions 
asked with the purpose of clarifying whether they are in a risc group or if 
the activity is legally allowed. 

The app would make friendly recommendations, without blocking the printing 
of the document.

Once the user has the pass they leave for work and meet a 
police(wo)man. They open the app and quickly show the form through the
closed car window. The information is structured and easy to understand 
from the distance so the police(wo)man doesn’t need to spend a long time 
reading and our user can continue their journey.

##Goals

- Generate the pass document while also advising the users whether it is a 
  good idea to leave their house.
- Provide information and links to reliable sources.
